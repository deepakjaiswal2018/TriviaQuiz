# TriviaQuiz
```
To get you started quickly, Iâ€™ve made a sample Trivia Quiz android app with a static set of textual questions with true &amp; 
false answer each of them. This can have at most one player for this sample quiz application. On choosing wrong answer, it make 
a vibrate to indicate that the chosen answer is incorrect and this will increase the user experience.
